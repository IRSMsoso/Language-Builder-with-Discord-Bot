First, we have to start with assumptions we make about the languages that can be created. Since we don't want it to be too difficult to program, we'll assume:

1. The language is comprised of words.
2. All words use the standard english alphabet and punctuation.
3. Different versions of the same word are counted as different words that are "related" to each other. (see word structure)
4. All different words have different texts.


Ideas:
A voting system for new words and language rules. Implemented
Easy ways to search for the above.
Saving to a file to keep progress. Implemented



Bot Commands:
After initial keyword like createlanguage, parameters will need to be indicated by putting parenthesis around them to simplify parsing the string.

createlanguage "Language Name"  - Creates a new language bound to the channel that this command is run in.
addrule
editrule
removerule
changename
addword "Text" "Pronunciation" "Definition" "Related word 1" "Related word 2" ... "Related word n"
removeword "Text"
editword "Text of word to edit" "Parameter (Text, Pronunciation, Definition)" "Change"
addrelatedword "Text of word to edit" "Text of related word"
removerelatedword "Text of word to edit" "Text of related word"



Outlining object structures:

Word:
Written representation - string. (Actual text of the word)
Written pronunciation - string. (The word sounded out, such as in english or using the International Phonetic Alphabet)
Other related words. - list. (This is a bit subjective per language, so what gos in each word's related list would likely be outlined in the language's rules)
Definition - string. (What it means)


Language:
Name - string
words - list of words
channel - int
rules - list of strings
intro_message - discord.Message (First message that includes an updated list of rules.)
