First, we have to start with assumptions we make about the languages that can be created. Since we don't want it to be too difficult to program, we'll assume:

1. The language is comprised of words.
2. Sentences get meaning across, and are comprised of the words of the language separated by a space.
3. Sentences and words are separated by punctuation, and that changes their meaning.
4. All words use the standard english alphabet and punctuation.
5. Different versions of the same word are counted as different words that are "related" to each other. (see word structure)


Ideas:
A voting system for new words, examples, and language rules.
Easy ways to search for the above.
Words/Examples of the day.
Uploading of audio clips as pronunciation examples.
Saving to a file to keep progress.

Outlining object structures:

Word:
Written representation - string. (Actual text of the word)
Written pronunciation - string. (The word sounded out, such as in english or using the International Phonetic Alphabet)
Other related words. - list. (This is a bit subjective per language, so what gos in each word's related list would likely be outlined in the language's rules)
Definition - string. (What it means)
Audio pronunciation? - ?. (Audio of the word)
